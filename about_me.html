			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>Hi! My name is Alex Brioux and I am a first year Honours Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. I enjoy learning about new technology and applying my knowledge of programming in both professional and educational environments. I am always willing to take on new challenges that help me develop my IT and programming background.</p>
			</br>
			<p>In addition to my love of Computer Science, I have an incredible passion for sports, and in particular, baseball. Sports always involve being competitive and I bring the same competitive attitude and work ethic to all that I do. Thanks for visiting my website!</p>
